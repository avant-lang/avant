# Avant Language changelog

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-14

### Changed
* The required `native` build uses the published `v0.4.0` compiler. Crystal `src/` is recovery (`recovery.yml`), not the merge gate.
* A version tag builds its compiler with that same `v0.4.0` seed and `runtime/build.sh`. `myc-llvm` is still built with Crystal.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-14

### Added
* `bind` and `b` on the identity compiler. The command drives `tools/bind.c` through libclang. The C visitor is unchanged.

### Changed
* The next tagged release asset is `avant-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, with the compiler named `avant`. `release.yml` opens a draft after the suite. `v0.1.0` is left as it is.
* GitHub `seed` checks that the `v0.1.0` compiler can build today's sources and pass the suite. `native` still builds A with Crystal.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-14

### Added
* Formatter

### Changed
* Daily compiles pass myc-llvm `--debug`. `AVANT_MYC_DEBUG=0` restores the previous codegen. `AVANT_MYC_FINAL=1` is unchanged. Crystal `src/` still builds A at myc's default.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-14

### Added
* Named interfaces: a static bound `T: Show`, a nominal opt-in, and no interface values.
